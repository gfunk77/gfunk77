### :octopus: About Me : 

I began coding as a hobby learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and quickly decided that I wanted to learn more and transition into an exciting new career in tech. Currently, I am currently enrolled at Tech Elevator as a Java student. Upon graduating, I am looking for a job as a software developer at an organization with a strong emphasis on collaboration so that I can leverage my skills as a team player, creative problem solver, and passionate learner.

I have been a freelance orchestra musician and music educator for a long time. I played my first paying gig when I was 16 years old and since then have been fortunate to perform with symphony orchestras all over the country and abroad. In addition to performing I have been worked as a music educator and orchestra director for both public and independent schools as well as at the university level. Connecting with audiences and reaching students really starts with making meaningful connections with the people you are working with. Both aspects of my career have allowed me to hone my skills as a leader and collaborator.
